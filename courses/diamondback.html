    <p><b>General description:</b>
        Since 1993, Diamondback Golf Club is a Clublink golf course located in the GTA North central area. 
        Designed by Rene Muylaert, this 18-hole golf facility is composed of many hills, valleys, and daunting 
        water hazards to carry. The front nine&#39s openness contrasts the tightly packed back nine that is 
        surrounded by tall trees and dense thickets. Diamondback has an adequate practice facility  
        comprised of a driving range with coloured targets, and a large putting and chipping green.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Review:</b>
        As one of Clublink's platinum level courses, Diamondback Golf Club is kept in exceptional shape with 
        fast greens and even fairways. The holes are average in length, and the bunkers are nicely maintained 
        throughout the course. Fairway and greenside bunkers are a common feature of Diamondback&#39s holes, as 
        well as the occasional water hazard stationed right before the green. A few of these water hazards require 
        you to carry the distance in order to finish the hole, which offers a refreshing challenge on your distance 
        control. The island green 8th and the 18th were the most memorable holes of the course, as they provided an 
        excellent finish to the front nine and the back nine respectively.

        <p>
        What stood out to me was the contrasting layouts of the front nine and the back nine; the first half of 
        my round at Diamondback transitioned into an entirely different experience going into the back nine. The 
        uniqueness of the course made my round enjoyable and entertaining, as it was full of twist and turns and 
        risky challenges. The consistency of the greens may vary at times, with some holes feeling softer than 
        other holes, though the course is generally deemed to be fast-rolling.

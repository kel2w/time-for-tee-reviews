    <p><b>General description:</b>
        The Rolling Hills Golf Club is a 36-hole golfing facility with a par-70 Challenge Course, a par-62 Classic 
        Course, and a par-72 Championship Course. However, the Championship Course went under renovation, and was  
        renamed as the Bethesda Grange Golf Course at The Rolling Hills Golf Club. This Clublink golf club is 
        ranked at the Silver Level by Clublink&#39s standards, and it takes on a simpler version of the Parkland-style 
        course type. For its amenities, Rolling Hills provides a practice range, a medium-sized putting green, and 
        a bistro for food and dining services during and after the round.

    <p><b>Review:</b>
        Bethesda Grange Golf Course offers a satisfactory golfing experience at an affordable rate, with its 
        comfortably walkable design, and throwing in a mixture of hills, creeks, lakes, and trees to add a 
        variety of challenges to the golf course. The overall quality of the course was average at best due to  
        uneven greens, patchy fairways, and poorly maintained hazards. There were stumps and broken tree branches 
        grouped in several areas of the course, and many untrimmed hazards that contributed to a shabby 
        appearance.
        </p>

        Bethesda Grange can get crowded at times, resulting in a slow pace of play with long waits between 
        shots. This is due to the Rolling Hill Golf Club&#39s popularity among casual golfers, as it is recognized 
        for its affordability and beginner-friendly course layout. If you aren&#39t looking to splurge on an 
        extravagant golfing experience or if you are just starting out in golf, Bethesda Grange is the perfect place 
        to practice your skills on the golf course.

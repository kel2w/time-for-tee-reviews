    <p><b>General description:</b>
        The North Course is one of the two 18-hole golf courses at the Angus Glen Golf Club known for hosting 
        the Canadian Open, a PGA event, in 2007. The course offers four tees to play from, and maintains bentgrass 
        greens and fairways bordered by fescue-covered dunes on each hole. Angus Glen Golf Club features an 
        extravagant clubhouse that provides full dining and proshop services, GPS golf carts, and excellent 
        practice facilities consisting of a driving range, two putting and chipping greens, and a bunker.

    <p><b>Review:</b>
        Compared to the South Course, the North Course is rather forgiving with its wide-open landscape, and 
        links-style course type originating from Scotland. It was satisfying to hit out of the rough and the 
        fairways, as the grass was thick and well-groomed for a solid, clean strike. However, the majority of the 
        fairways are heavily sloped with a tendency of the holes to end downhill. The difficulty of this course 
        lies with distance control, especially on the downhill par 3s, and playing around the fast-rolling greens 
        decorated with sod wall bunkers. Pictured above is Hole 13, depicting a picturesque view of the dogleg hole 
        bending around an extensive lake. Visually, it is a mentally challenging hole, which is why it&#39s my 
        favourite hole on this course, as it is provides a fun challenge alongside a beautiful view. 
        </p>

            I noticed that the North Course played slightly longer from the tees than the typical golf course in 
            Ontario, though the occasional downhill slopes may compensate for the extra distance. Also, the holes 
            are fairly spaced out, which requires a lengthier walk than usual to get to the next hole if you 
            aren&#39t taking carts. From my experience, the pacing of the course was usually unhurried given the 
            generous amount of space between the holes, and the tendency of players to take power carts instead of 
            walking on foot. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course for a less stimulating round of golf, 
            due to its straightforward layout.

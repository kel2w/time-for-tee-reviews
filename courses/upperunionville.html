    <p><b>General description:</b>
        Formerly known as The Mandarin Golf & Country Club in 1991, this private-turned-public golf course was 
        renamed as the Upper Unionville Golf Club under the Copper Creek Golf Group (CCGG). The CCGG offers a 
        flex membership which provides player benefits to four courses: Upper Unionville, Copper Creek, 
        Watson&#39s Glen, and Peninsula Lakes. This course was designed by Doug Carrick, who maintained the classic 
        style of 1920&#39s and 30&#39s golf courses, while adding a modern twist to it. The fairways are generous 
        and the greens are on the softer side, however, they are surrounded by strategically placed bunkers.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Review:</b>
        When I first played at Upper Unionville, the fairways felt exceptionally spacious and nicely cut, and the 
        greens rolled at a fine speed; it was not too firm nor too soft. The course challenges your course 
        management skills by requiring a good aim and distance to find the fairways, as it is filled with doglegs 
        ranging from a slight, smooth bend to a near 90-degree curve around a pond or a dense forest. I enjoyed 
        taking on Upper Unionville&#39s par 3s, as each of them were beautifully designed with a unique degree of 
        difficulty using a variety of elements.</p> 
        
    <p>I found the most remarkable hole of the course to be its island green on the 16th hole (as shown in the photo 
        above), boasting a magnificent view of the green surrounded on all sides by a daunting lake. The lake 
        is home to the balls of countless unlucky golfers and a few toads that may be spotted as you cross the 
        bridge to the putting green. In the recent years I have revisited this course, I noticed that the texture  
        of the fairways have gotten dry and patchy. Nonetheless, Upper Unionville is always a pleasure to play at, 
        and I would recommend this course if you are looking for something moderately challenging with 
        decent-sized fairways. </p>

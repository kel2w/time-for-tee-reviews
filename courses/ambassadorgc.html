    <p><b>General description:</b>
        Ambassador Golf Club is a public golf course located in Windsor, Ontario, designed by the world-renowned 
        architect Thomas McBroom. This links golf course measures 7033 yards from the back tees, and its holes are 
        decorated with numerous bunkers and a massive lake bordering multiple holes. For its practice facility, they 
        provide a driving range and a massive 8000 sq. ft. putting green. Ambassador Golf Club has multiple venues 
        for formal events, and a grill that opens to an outdoor patio for dining services. This course is fairly 
        walkable, but they also offer GPS power carts as an option. 
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Review:</b>
        There are no trees in play, however, there is a huge man-made lake as the main water hazard of the course, 
        and plenty of irregularly-shaped bunkers guarding both sides of the holes. Ambassador Golf Club is perfect 
        for accurate, long hitters, as it provides many opportunities for a risk/reward tee shot and offers an 
        advantage to those who can carry over the sand traps. Wind is an important factor to consider when choosing 
        your club, especially on your tee shots due to the lack of cover and the openness of the course.
        </p> 

        <p>
          The course was in top condition from the tee box to the green; the bunkers were exceptionally tidy, the 
          fescues and fairways were uniformly cut, and the greens rolled true. Ambassador is a challenging golf 
          course, as it is unforgiving if you miss the fairways anywhere to the right or the left. You may find 
          yourself in a tough spot, whether it be in the long grass, the extended lake or the multiple sand traps 
          clustered around the greens and the sides of the fairways. All in all, Ambassador Golf Club is an amazing 
          public course to check out for an exciting and enjoyable round of golf.

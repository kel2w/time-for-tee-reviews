    <p><b>General description:</b>
        Hylands Golf Club is a private golf facility located near the Ottawa Internation Airport in Ottawa, ON, 
        with the purpose of providing affordable golf and services to military forces. The South Course began its 
        development in 1961, while plans to construct the North Course commenced in 1969. Hylands Golf Club 
        officially opened in 1972, resembling a Parkland-style golf course, as each hole is divided by an 
        abundance of trees.

    <p><b>Review:</b>
       I played at Hylands in the fall, and the course was in good shape despite the windy weather scattering  
       leaves all over. I would say the biggest obstacle is getting your shot out of the trees from a bad slice 
       or hook. There were no water hazards on the entire course except for Hylands&#39 scenic 18th hole, which 
       featured a large pond fountain just before the green. If you opt to hit longer, you may find the bunker 
       in the back — No. 18 is considered to be the most challenging hole on the South Course, with 
       emphasis on making the right club selection and committing to the shot for a good score. 
        </p> 

        <p>
            The South Course&#39s putting greens were well-kept, but they were considerably larger than the green 
            sizes of other courses in the region, especially its par 3s. Around the greens, there were tidy, compact 
            bunkers that are often positioned on the front left side. From the tee, the line of trees on both sides 
            of the fairway produced a narrow look, and many holes sharing the same linear layout with a few trees 
            on the side as an obstacle made the golfing experience somewhat repetitive. The simplicity of this 
            golf course does not offer much excitement in a round, however, it is a good quality course for the 
            average golfer.
